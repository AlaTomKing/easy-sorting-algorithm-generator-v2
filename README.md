# easy sorting algorithm generator v2
This is better than easy sorting algorithm generator v1 because it has more algorithms!

This is also licensed under the MIT License but that's okay, you can still take my project and do anything you want with it as long as you keep the license.

## List of algorithms

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Merge sort
- Shell sort
- Counting sort

## What?
Just read the description from my v1 page because I am too lazy to write anything and I hope your questions are answered.

## How to change the settings
Okay this question I will answer because it is impossible to change the settings in the v1 version.

Either go to the console or press <kbd>M</kbd>

***Good sorting!***
